          You are planning a marketing campaign.
          Decide how many agents to create (e.g., strategist, designer, copywriter) and specify their roles and system prompts.
          Define the 'task_sequence' as a list of {'task_name': task, 'agent_name': name, 'instruction': instruction, 'params': params, 'queue': 'queue_name'}.
          Assign each task a unique queue based on the agent's role (e.g., 'strategy_queue', 'design_queue').
          Return JSON with 'agents' (array) and 'task_sequence'.
