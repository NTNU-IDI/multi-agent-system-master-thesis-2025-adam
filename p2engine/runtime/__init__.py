runtime package bootstrap

Only declare the public sub-packages here; DO NOT import heavy
modules at import-time â€“ that can create circular-import traps
(e.g. the former `from . import handlers` line).

Anything that needs `runtime.handlers` (or other internals) should
`import runtime.handlers` *inside the function that uses it* or at
the very end of its own module.
