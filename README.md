## Abstract

This thesis presents P2Engine, a production-ready framework for orchestrating conversational AI agents with distributed task execution and integrated financial ledger capabilities. The system demonstrates how multiple AI agents can collaborate through delegation hierarchies while maintaining transactional integrity through blockchain technology.

## Quick Overview

**P2Engine** is the core implementation of this thesis, featuring:

- Multi-agent conversation orchestration
- Canton/Daml-based financial ledger integration
- Distributed task processing with Celery
- Comprehensive evaluation framework
- A/B testing capabilities for agent configurations

For detailed technical documentation, installation instructions, and usage examples, please refer to [`p2engine/README.md`](p2engine/README.md).

## Results

The `results/` directory contains:

- **images/**: Screenshots of agent interactions and system outputs
- **videos/**: Recorded simulation runs demonstrating multi-agent collaboration
- **data/**: Raw experimental data from rollout evaluations
- **analysis/**: Jupyter notebooks with performance analysis
