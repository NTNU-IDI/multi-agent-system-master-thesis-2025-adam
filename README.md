# P2Engine: A Multi-Agent System Framework

**A framework + runtime to build, run, and evaluate multi-agent systems. Extended with the Canton Network to enable monetary incentives, payments, and audits.**

**The primary entry point is `p2engine/README.md`, which offers setup instructions and a full overview of the framework.**

Orchestrate many AI agents with _observable_ workflows, _adaptive_ evaluation loops, and an _auditable_ trail.
