## Abstract

This thesis presents **p2engine**, a modular framework for fully autonomous systems that integrates finite-state multi-agent coordination with distributed ledger technology (DLT). The system demonstrates how autonomous agents can operate with verifiable accountability while continuously adapting through learning-enabled architectures.

## Core Contributions

1. **FSM-Orchestrated Multi-Agent Systems**: Precise coordination with observable state transitions
2. **DLT-Backed Verifiable Infrastructure**: Immutable audit trails ensuring accountability and defense against tampering
3. **Learning-Enabled Autonomy**: Integrated evaluators and reasoners for continuous system improvement
4. **Empirical Validation**: Demonstrated effectiveness across coordination, traceability, payments, and judgment scenarios
5. **Open-Source Research Platform**: Reusable framework for future autonomous systems research

## Quick Start

**p2engine** realizes autonomous systems through:

- **Agents**: Configurable skills, artifacts, and communication protocols
- **Orchestration**: FSM-driven workflows ensuring precise coordination
- **Infrastructure**: DLT integration for verifiable, privacy-aware operations
- **Learning**: MCTS/RL-based reasoners with automated evaluation

For implementation details, see [`p2engine/README.md`](p2engine/README.md).

## Key Results

The framework addresses three interrelated challenges:

1. **Coordination**: FSM-based orchestration enables complex multi-agent workflows
2. **Verification**: Every action is traceable and defendable via DLT
3. **Adaptation**: Systematic feedback loops enable continuous improvement

Validated through simulations demonstrating:

- Effective agent collaboration
- Complete action traceability
- Automated payment processing
- Performance-based judgment and learning

## Future Directions

- Self-optimizing coordination via reinforcement learning
- Scalable ecosystems with cross-MAS interoperability
- Formal verification of system correctness
- Enterprise deployment considerations
